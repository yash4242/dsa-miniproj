//in case this person comes out + then a function which informs his primary contacts& secondary contacts;
//i.e. updates those people's riskFactor




//make a function whichdoes the following:
//once this person comes into a new city
//the function adds all the people of the city a person is living in, into its primaryContactList
//this function should also add this person to all other residents' primaryContactList

//key thing to notice: when you add a personB to person A's primary contact list,
//person B's primary contacts become person A's secondary and person A's primary become person B's
//secondary


/**************************************************** MAIN NEEDED FUNCTION ********************************************************************/

// make a function which changes the riskFactor of contacts of all persons as soon as a person or multiple persons are declared Covid Positive ...// 

//traverse through the covidList array and for each person on the list:
      //  print out his primary contacts if date of meeting was within currentDay and currentDay - 14
       // similarly for 2ndary contacts
